                    On average, consumers throw out 1/3 of the food items they purchase. Every piece of food that is thrown out required numerous resources to grow. Most people only relate their groceries to a monetary value and don't think about how much effort it took to produce them. Growing crops uses tons of water, nutrients from the soil, energy from the sun, and farmer's time and hard work. These resources are limited and when each person throws away 1/3 of the food they purchase, all of this goes to waste.
